## üìù Blogs  

### Blog 1: Using Apache Kafka to Measure and Track Car Analytics in a Carpooling Application  
This blog explores leveraging Apache Kafka for real-time car and driver analytics in a carpool app. Kafka's scalability, fault tolerance, and real-time processing ensure efficient monitoring of metrics such as driver performance, vehicle health, and trip details. 

Implementation Steps: 
- **Kafka Topics**: Define topics for driver and vehicle metrics and ride events.
- **Producers & Consumers**: Stream data via IoT devices to Kafka for backend analytics.  
- **Real-Time Processing**: Use Kafka Streams for alerts and insights. 
- **Data Integration**: Connect with databases and machine learning models for predictive analysis.

### Blog 2: Deploying an EKS Cluster on AWS using Terraform: A Step-by-Step Guide  
This guide explains how to use **Terraform** to automate the provisioning of an Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) cluster. It covers prerequisites like AWS CLI setup and Terraform installation, writing a Terraform configuration file for the EKS cluster, and initializing and applying the configuration. 

Key Highlights:  
- Configure Terraform files for the VPC and EKS cluster.
- Use terraform init, plan, and apply commands for deployment.
- Connect to the EKS cluster with kubectl.
- Deploy a sample Nginx application and clean up resources using terraform destroy.
